Sprites

Goku from the game “Dragon Ball Z: Extreme Butōden”

	To create the sprites I simply downloaded them from Spriters-Resource.com, clipped the individual images with an Online sprite sheet cutter / splitter / decompiler, and later recompile the image as a gif in Piskel with control speed, duration, and size.

Ryu from the game “Street Fighter III: New Generation
